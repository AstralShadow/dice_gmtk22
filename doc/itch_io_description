Since most people won't stay long enough, i shall note this here: The number of enemies is decided with a roll. The chances of getting more enemies increase with every encounter. The highest difficulty it can get is being as fair as a dice roll.


[SPOILER] Dice power-ups:
heal - you can always feel better.
rush - get fast. like real fast. as long as it lasts
shield - safety first, live in a bubble
slow motion - is it actually useful?
time freeze - full opposite of the next one
??? - this one didn't reach the spoiler section.
Treat the last power-up as one of the Easter eggs. Comment if you find the other.


As mentioned in the comments, bullet collisions are off.
You should stay further from the bullets so it don't affect you.
